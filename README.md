# Nondeterministic-Finite-Automata
A partial nondeterministic finite automata without epsilon transitions that takes a user defined state machine with defined start, final, and transition states and outputs the resulting accept/reject states. This program can handle up to 1000 states and a million transitions. 

Two example finite state machine text file is provided
